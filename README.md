In this project, the user can register, log in, and reset
                  their password via email. Upon successful login, the user sees
                  a list of all tasks and can filter them using the panel at the
                  top. Additionally, task pages utilize PrivateRoute, meaning
                  that if a user is not logged in, they cannot access these
                  pages. Tasks themselves can be added, edited, deleted, and
                  their status changed, with all changes being recorded in the
                  database
